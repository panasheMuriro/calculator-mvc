# Calculator Model View Controller refresher

## Purpose
This application is to refresh my skills in using the MVC design pattern. 
* Model represents the data and business logic of the application. 
* View is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user.
* Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

## How it works
* The `controller` has the `runApp` method
* It creates instances of `CalculatorModel` and `CalculatorView`.
* It uses `view` to get two numbers from the user via `askUserInput`.
* It uses `model` to calculate the sum of the two numbers using `add:to:`.
* Finally, it uses view to display the result using displayResult.
